## Diabetes Prediction

According to IDF (the International Diabetes Federation) 1 in 10 people are living with diabetes: https://idf.org/. 

### Project Overview
Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early diagnosis and prediction of diabetes can be crucial for timely intervention and better management of the disease. This machine learning project aims to build a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis based on medical records. The model shouldn't be used for self-diagnosis, rather as a recommendation to visit medical professional.

The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to develop an accurate and reliable predictive model for diabetes. I utilized a publicly available dataset containing various attributes related to diabetes diagnosis and health metrics. The dataset is available on Kaggle platform (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset).
